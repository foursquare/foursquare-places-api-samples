# Places API Leaflet Example

This example demonstrates how to call the Places API and return data for a map object using pure js and css. 

To run this example open the [main.js](./js/main.js) file and add your FSQ_API_KEY to line 29. Then open [index.html](./index.html) in a browser and conduct a search to see the map annotated with results.
