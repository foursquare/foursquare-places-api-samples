# Foursquare Places API Examples :blue_book:

This repo contains examples for developers to quickly get started with Foursquare's Places API. Example use cases and features are outlined below. 

Each example has a README that explains how to use it. Every example requires a API key to run successfully, so be sure to have one ready or generate a new key in the [Foursquare Developer Console]().
